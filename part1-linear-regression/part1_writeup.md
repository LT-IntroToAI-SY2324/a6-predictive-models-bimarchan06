# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value is 0.6257932855322312

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic bp for a 43 yr is 137.46185286

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think that are a good estimate for people's blood presure but they don't fit everyone. Every person may have different levels and I think other factors other than age will make the differences in individuals blood pressure. I think that we can improve this data by taking more samples and taking more diverse data so that it can b more accurate.
