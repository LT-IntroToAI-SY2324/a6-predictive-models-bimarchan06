# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

Purple(high spending score with low income): the spendthrifters
Green(spends less but has low income): The frugalists
Blue(median): Your average Joe
Orange(spends more and earns more): The deep pocketers
Red(spend less, earn less): The realists

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

They would be in the frugalists group (Green group)

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The cluster of my interest would be the purple group. I think that people in this group want to fake being rich. Since they spend alot, I think that they have the "fake it until they make it" mindset. I think that the marketing team would apporach this group by making alot of designer brand products with big logos because it will help them show their "wealth". The team would also have to make all of the accessories more extravgant as they focus on appearing rich rather than being. They could also target the group by using more materialistic appearence in ways so that the "wealth" can be shown.
