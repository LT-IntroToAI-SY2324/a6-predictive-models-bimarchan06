# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The R squared coeficent for this model is 0.86. This tells how my model has paired well with my dataand thus is a representation of it.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Yes my data is accurate because in order for a coefficent to be strong it must be greater than 0.7 and so since my coefficent is 0.86 that makes my data representation more accurate.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The model predicts the 10 yr old car with 89K miles to be worth: $8923.96 dollars.
The model predicts the 20 yr old car with 150k miles to be worth $1919.06 dollars.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This happens because as time and use of a car increases,the value of a car depreciates with it as well. I think that after a certain time and usage of a car it becomes negative because it has been overused and not as reliable because of it. The wear and tear of the car overpowers the price you purchased the car for. This makes this car purchase a risk since it no longer is in a good shape.
