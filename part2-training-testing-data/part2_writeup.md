# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the previous lesson because it has a larger scale of data. It allows for more items to be examined and that allows more ground to be covered.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R square coefficient tells us how the ae of a person doesn't give a direct corelation/ effect with blood pressure.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

The predicted and actual values are accurate. On the American heart association website, it gives a range of different blood pressure levels that can be healthy ot unhealthy. According to the American Heart Assocation, the normal lvels for blood pressure of a 17 year old range form 80 to 120 and on the predicted data, the value is 114. This value is in between the range of normal blood pressures which shows how the predicted numbers are accurate according to the American Heart Association.
